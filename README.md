I’m a Cloud Security Analyst with a strong focus on network defence, threat detection, and incident investigation, currently progressing toward a Network Security Engineer role. My day-to-day work involves analysing suspicious traffic, investigating alerts, reviewing authentication activity, and identifying potential threats across enterprise environments using Microsoft security technologies.

Through hands-on investigations and real-world incidents, I’ve developed a deep understanding of attacker behaviour, network patterns, and defensive security strategies. This operational experience has driven my passion for designing secure infrastructures rather than only responding to threats — pushing me toward engineering secure and resilient network solutions.

I’m actively expanding my expertise in cloud security, secure networking, firewall analysis, and threat hunting while pursuing industry certifications and building practical lab environments to strengthen my engineering skill set.

My goal is to transition into a Network Security Engineer role where I can combine investigative experience with secure architecture design to build proactive, scalable, and resilient security solutions that protect modern cloud and enterprise networks.
